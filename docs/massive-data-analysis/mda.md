# Notes of Massive Data Analysis

## 1 INTRODUCTION

> When combined with arguments that simple algorithms can work better than more sophisticated algorithms on large-scale data (see, e.g., Halevy et al., 2009), it is natural to be bullish on big data.

> But the goals for massive data go beyond the storage, indexing, and querying that have been the province of classical database systems (and classical search engines), instead focusing on the ambitious goal of **inference**.

> The field of statistics aims to provide a mathematical understanding of inference, quantifying the degree of support that data offer for assertions of knowledge as well as providing a basis for evaluating actions that are proposed on the basis of these assertions.
>
> ......
>
> There are many additional issues that impinge on **the quality of inference**.
> A major issue is that of **sampling bias**. ...... Another major issue is **provenance**. ......


> The focus in this report is on the technical issues—computational and inferential—that surround massive data.
